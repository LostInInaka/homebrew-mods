Sometimes using homebrew can be a little difficult due to a variety of factors, for example outdated brews, or perl/ruby/etc autolinking to the "closest site" which just so happens to timeout or not have newer sources.

So, to help with autoinstalls, I have slightly modified a few scripts so that they can work easily and simpily by either tapping my repo or installing directly.
